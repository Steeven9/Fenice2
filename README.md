### Dependencies

The website has a few integrations with some external services (100% self-hosted),
which are not strictly required to run the website but might be needed for some parts of it:

- **MongoDB database** to store characters and campaigns.
Required to browse, create, and edit characters and campaigns
- **Keycloak** OIDC identity provider to allow users to login and store their characters.
Required to create and edit characters
- **S3 storage** to store the documents (we use MinIO, optional)
- **Gcal-API** to easily fetch the date of our next session from our shared calendar
(see [steeven9/Gcal-API](https://github.com/Steeven9/Gcal-API), optional)
- **Home Assistant** with the Alexa integration to announce whose turn it is in combat (optional)

## üè° Local development

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Node.js v22
- Yarn package manager
- Docker (if you want to run MongoDB locally)

### üîß Installation

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# bootstrap local configuration
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then adapt the values in the `.env.local` file depending
on which external services you need (see "Dependencies" section).

### üöÄ Run locally

```bash
# start DB
docker-compose up mongodb -d

# start frontend
yarn dev
```

Finally, open your browser and head to <http://localhost:3000>.
The first load might take a while, so be patient!

### üìÑ Mock data

If you want to load some characters and campaigns, there is some example data in the
`mock_data` folder.

You will need a running MongoDB database and the
[MongoDB database tools](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/installation/installation)

To load it in the MongoDB database, simply run the script:

```bash
cd mock_data

./load_data.sh
```
